        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 medium yellow onion (diced)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked and cooled white rice</li>
            <li> Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup hibachi master sauce *See note</li>
            <li>1/2-1 Tablespoon sesame oil (to taste)</li>
            <li>Chopped green onions (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large, heavy duty skillet, melt 1 1/2
                tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
                Add the onion and saute until starting to 
                soften, about three minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the frozen vegetables and cook until
                heated through, another few minutes. Stir in
                the garlic and saute until fragrant, about
                30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Push the veggie mixture to the side, and crack
                two eggs into the pan. Use a spatula to scramble
                the egg and cook, stirring occasionally, chopping
                them into smaller pieces, until mostly set.
            </li>
            <li>Push the eggs to the side, and melt the
                remaining butter. Turn the heat up to high and 
                then add the cooked rice. Spread it over the
                pan and allow it to cook undisturbed for a few
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the veggies and egg into the rice, and season
                everything lightly with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the hibachi sauce into the pan and cook 
                stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pan,
                until the sauce is absorbed. Drizzle in the sesame 
                oil and stir until combined.
            </li>
            <li>serve the rice with chopped green onions, if desired,
                and hibachi steak and veggies on the side.
            </li>
        </ol>
